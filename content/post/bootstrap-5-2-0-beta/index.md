TABot 1.0 Beta

> We are excited to announce the launch of **TABot 1.0 Beta**! This release introduces a powerful AI-driven teaching assistant designed to enhance the learning experience for students and educators alike.

TABot leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to provide instant responses to student inquiries, making it an invaluable resource for maintaining study momentum outside of traditional classroom hours. 

### Key Features:
- **Course Material Upload**: Instructors can upload course materials (PDFs, lecture notes) to train TABot, ensuring accurate responses based on course content.
- **Historical Data Integration**: Teaching assistants can upload past Q&A data, allowing TABot to learn from previous interactions and common questions.
- **Instant Responses**: Students can ask questions anytime and receive immediate answers, even when teaching assistants are unavailable.
- **AI Response Review**: Instructors can review and modify TABot's responses to ensure accuracy and appropriateness.
- **Usage Metrics Tracking**: Administrators can track usage metrics across different courses to optimize resource allocation and improve the system.

Given the size of this update and the time since our last release, we're launching it as a beta first.
